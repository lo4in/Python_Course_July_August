## 7. Practice Exercises with Solutions

### Exercise 1: Username Validator

**Task:** Ask the user to enter a username. If it starts with a capital letter and is at least 5 characters long, print "Valid"; otherwise, print "Invalid".


### Exercise 2: Even or Odd Checker

**Task:** Task: Even or Odd Checker
# Objective:
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter an integer number and checks whether the number is even or odd.
# Instructions:
Prompt the user to enter an integer using input().
Convert the input to an integer using int().
Use the modulo operator (%) to determine whether the number is even or odd:
If a number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0, it's even.
Otherwise, it's odd.
Print "The number is even." or "The number is odd." based on the result.

### Exercise 3: Password Strength Checker

**Objective:**  
Create a Python program that checks the strength of a user-entered password based on basic rules.

---

**Requirements:**

1. Prompt the user to enter a password.
2. Evaluate the password based on the following criteria:
   - Minimum length of 8 characters.
   - Contains at least one uppercase letter.
   - Contains at least one lowercase letter.
   - Contains at least one digit.
   - Contains at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`).
3. Print a message indicating whether the password is **Strong**, **Moderate**, or **Weak**:
   - **Strong**: meets all 5 criteria.
   - **Moderate**: meets 3–4 criteria.
   - **Weak**: meets less than 3 criteria.


###  Exercise 4: Ticket Price Calculator

**Objective:**  
Write a Python program that calculates the price of a movie ticket based on the customer's age.

   - Age **under 5**: Free (₩0)
   - Age **5–12**: ₩5
   - Age **13–59**: ₩10
   - Age **60 and above**: ₩7
3. Print the ticket price.

### Additional Hometask:

* Write a program that asks for a string and prints the number of vowels.
* Ask the user to input a number and print whether it is divisible by 3 and 5.
* Ask for name and age. If age is under 18, print "Minor", else "Adult".
* Ask for a password and ensure it does not contain spaces and is at least 10 characters long.
